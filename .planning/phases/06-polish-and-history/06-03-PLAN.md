<objective>
Apply UX polish to the chore list and history views with smooth transitions, optimized touch targets, and visual refinement. Includes a human verification checkpoint to leverage frontend-design skill for visual polish suggestions.

Purpose: Field workers need an app that feels fast and is easy to use with dirty hands or in bright sunlight. Polish transforms functional into delightful.

Output: Animated transitions on chore state changes, optimized touch targets, refined visual hierarchy, and user-verified polish.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Svelte transitions to chore list</name>
  <files>src/routes/(app)/+page.svelte</files>
  <action>
Add smooth transitions to the chore list for state changes:

1. Import transitions at top of script:
```svelte
import { fade, slide } from 'svelte/transition';
```

2. Add transition directives to chore items:
- Use `transition:slide={{ duration: 150 }}` on each chore-item li
- This creates smooth entry/exit when list changes

3. Add fade transition to completion status changes:
- The completion-info div should use `transition:fade={{ duration: 200 }}`

4. Optimize the toggle button animation:
- Add CSS transition for background-color change (already may exist)
- Ensure the check icon fade-in is smooth

Keep durations short (150-200ms) for responsive feel.
Do NOT add transitions to the main container or sections - only to items that actually change.

Note: Per research, avoid JavaScript animations - use CSS transforms/opacity only.
  </action>
  <verify>Complete a chore, see smooth animation. Undo completion, see reverse animation.</verify>
  <done>Chore completions animate smoothly with slide and fade transitions.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Optimize touch targets and spacing</name>
  <files>
    src/routes/(app)/+page.svelte
    src/routes/(app)/history/+page.svelte
  </files>
  <action>
Ensure all interactive elements meet touch target requirements:

For +page.svelte (chore list):
1. Verify toggle button is at least 44px (it's currently 2rem = 32px - too small!)
   - Increase to min-width: 48px; min-height: 48px
2. Ensure chore-item has comfortable padding (currently 1rem is good)
3. Add min-height: 48px to chore-item for consistent touch area
4. Ensure retry button has min 44px touch area

For history/+page.svelte:
1. Ensure history cards have min-height: 48px
2. Add adequate padding to cards (16px)
3. Ensure photo thumbnails are tappable (already should be via PhotoThumbnail)
4. Back button/nav should be 48px minimum

CSS updates needed:
```css
.toggle-button {
  min-width: 48px;
  min-height: 48px;
  /* ... existing styles */
}

.chore-item {
  min-height: 48px;
  /* ... existing styles */
}
```

Remove any instances of sizes smaller than 44px for interactive elements.
  </action>
  <verify>Use browser devtools to measure touch targets. All interactive elements should be at least 44px.</verify>
  <done>All touch targets meet WCAG 2.2 minimum of 44px, with 48px for primary actions.</done>

  <name>Task 3: Visual polish verification with frontend-design skill</name>
  <what-built>
Applied transitions and optimized touch targets to the chore list and history views. The UI should now feel smoother and be easier to use on mobile devices.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open the app on a mobile device or mobile emulator (Chrome DevTools device mode)
2. Test the chore list:
   - Tap chores to complete - observe smooth animations
   - Verify toggle buttons are comfortable to tap (not too small)
   - Check visual hierarchy (headers, categories, items)
3. Test the history view:
   - Scroll through date groups
   - Verify cards are easy to read
   - Check photo thumbnails are appropriately sized
4. **Optional enhancement**: If the user wants additional visual polish, they can invoke the frontend-design skill to suggest:
   - Color scheme refinements
   - Spacing adjustments
   - Animation timing tweaks
   - Shadow and elevation improvements

Please verify:
- Animations feel smooth (not janky)
- Touch targets are comfortable
- Visual hierarchy is clear
- Overall feel is polished for field use

If any issues, describe them for fixes. If approved, phase is complete.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to complete the phase, or describe issues that need fixing.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Run `npm run dev` and test on mobile device/emulator
2. Complete chores and observe transitions
3. Navigate to history and verify layout
4. Measure touch targets with devtools (all >= 44px)
5. Get user approval on overall polish
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Svelte transitions applied to chore list items
- Touch targets meet 44px minimum (48px for primary actions)
- UI feels responsive and smooth
- User approves visual polish
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-polish-and-history/06-03-SUMMARY.md`
